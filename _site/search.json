This new approach is significantly more accurate than our previous method, which will help us make better financial decisions and manage our mortgage portfolio more effectively.\nKey Points:\n\nOur new prediction model is about 3 times more accurate than the old one\nIt can explain 94% of the differences in case resolution times, up from 39%\nThis improvement will help us value assets more accurately and make better-informed decisions\n\n\n\n\nKnowing how long a foreclosure case will take is crucial for our business. It helps us:\n1. Value our mortgage assets more accurately\n2. Make better decisions about managing our portfolio\n3. Plan our financial strategies more effectively\n\n\n\nOur old method was simple but not the most accurate:\n1. We looked at past foreclosure cases\n2.
